I do not understand the following problems :=

1. Majority element 1 and Majority element 2 . Thought I can the algorithm to Majority element K as well where k > 2.

2. 2sum, 3sum and 4sum problems.

3. The intuition behind mergeSortedArraysWithoutExtraSpace method 2. Could anyone please give me a mathematical proof of the algorithm. I am not able to generalize this algorithm.

4. The GAP method is very non-intuitive as well. Any mathematical proof would be appreciated.
