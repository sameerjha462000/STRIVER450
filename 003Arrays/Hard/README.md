I do not understand the following problems :=

1. Majority element 1 and Majority element 2 . Though I can write the algorithm of Majority element K as well where K > 2.

2. 2sum, 3sum, 4sum and Ksum problems.

3. The intuition behind mergeSortedArraysWithoutExtraSpace method 2. Could anyone please give me a mathematical proof of the algorithm. I am not able to generalize this algorithm. What is this i++, j++, k--.

4. The GAP method for mergeSortWithoutExtraSpace is also very non-intuitive.
